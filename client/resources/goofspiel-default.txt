; Code a bot to play Goofspiel
;
; The game is played with 3 'decks' of 1 through 12.
; Each turn, a trophy card is revealed and you
; and your opponent bid with one of your cards.
; The highest bid scores the value of the trophy card.
; Highest score after 12 cards wins.
;
; Sample Input:
;    { "me" 12345
;      "player-cards" {12345 #{ 1 2 3 13 }
;                      54321 #{ 1 2 3 13 }}
;      "trophy-cards" #{ 1 2 3 13 }
;      "current-trophy" 4
;      "history"  [ { 12345 1 54321 1 "trophy" 1 } â€¦ ] }
;
; Sample Output:
;   5
;
; When you're ready to test your code, hit 'Test'.
; Your bot will be put up against a random opponent.
; (println) and error output is shown on the right.
; Fix any bugs, and when you're happy, hit 'Deploy'.
