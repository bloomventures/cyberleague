; Code a bot to play Goofspiel
;
; The game is played with 3 'decks' of 1 through 12.
; Each turn, a trophy card is revealed and you
; and your opponent bid with one of your cards.
; The highest bid scores the value of the trophy card.
; Highest score after 12 cards wins.
;
; Sample Input:
;    { :your-cards #{ 1 2 3 12 }
;      :their-cards #{ 2 3 12 52 }
;      :trophy-cards #{ 1 2 3 }
;      :current-trophy 6
;      :history [ { :you 1 :them 1 :trophy 1 } â€¦ ] } }
;
; Sample Output:
;   5
;
; When you're ready to test your code, hit 'Test'.
; Your bot will be put up against a random opponent.
; (println) and error output is shown on the right.
; Fix any bugs, and when you're happy, hit 'Deploy'.
