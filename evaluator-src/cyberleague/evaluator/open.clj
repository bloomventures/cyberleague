;; It would be straighforward for this to take fns instead of closeables, and

;; be more flexible, but in a probably useless way that would also either generate
;; more classes #(close %), or embed current value of the close fn in
;; macroexpand sites (partial close) which can frustrate code-reloading and
;; with-redefs. So this function is specific to closing, which seems appropriate
;; for this namespace.
